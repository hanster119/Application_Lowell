        <p>Dear Lowell Recruiters,</p>
        <p>When I came across the position at Lowell, I was attracted by the opportunity to apply my experience in liquidity management, payment operations, and financial analysis in a Nordic environment with a company working for the good cause, for people. The position aligns closely with both my current responsibilities in Treasury operations and personal traits like detail-recognition, precision, analytical thinking and proactivity in problem-solving.</p>
        <p>I hold a Master of Science in Economics from Hanken School of Economics, majoring in finance. During my studies, I focused especially on developing my ability to analyze financial data and build structured, data-driven market insights. My master’s thesis alone involved over 70 hours of data analysis using Excel and R-Studio. Attending various courses in data analysis, modelling, and presentation, along with later IT studies, further strengthened my capacity to understand complex financial processes and apply structured, data-driven thinking to support sound financial decision-making. These skills combined with my tech-savviness, high energy, and key attention to numerical detail, have been essential in handling complex payment and liquidity management challenges in my current role.</p>
        <p>In my one-year role in Treasury back-office operations, I manage short-term forecasting, cash pool monitoring, payment processing and resolution of payment issues on behalf of all KONE Companies. I also prepare monthly cash flow reports, and act as co-administrator for bank and payment tool user rights, while also handling KYC, compliance, and bank account opening/closing processes on a daily basis. This work has strengthened my analytical and problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and ability to identify risks and improve complex financial processes. Handling daily liquidity and ensuring smooth intra-group operations has prepared me to take ownership of treasury responsibilities and deliver reliable results in a fast-paced, high-stakes environment.</p>
        <p>Before KONE, I had an internship with EY’s Transaction Tax team, acquired based on success within a case competition. I worked on M&A tax advising, analyzed the alignment of financial statements and tax declarations, and managed tight deadlines for project-based assignments. The experiences at KONE and EY have greatly sharpened my problem-solving skills in high-pressure, time-critical settings.</p>
        <p>I have previously gained versatile experience in banking and taxation, assisting and executing transactions, and advising on efficient tax reporting through an online reporting portal, for instance. I have also worked in insurance sales, developing my ability to identify client needs and recognizing opportunities. Across these roles, I have interacted with a wide variety of customers in three languages, greatly developing my communication skills. Simultaneously, I also have strong foundations for communication and collaboration due to my sociable, easily approachable nature, Swedish-Finnish bilingualism, and English skills from my English-speaking high-school diploma.</p>
        <p>Over the past eight months, I have strengthened my ability to manage complex treasury and financial processes, receiving positive feedback for my neat problem-solving, proactivity, and attention to crucial details. I am now eager to bring this experience to a long-term role at Lowell, where the Lead Treasury Specialist responsibilities align directly with what I manage daily. I am motivated by Lowell’s Nordic roots, its people-focused value of fairness, as well as its focus on innovation. I am eager to contribute to the company’s continued success and make a positive impact for all its customers.</p>
        <p1>Thank you for your consideration and best wishes!</p1>
